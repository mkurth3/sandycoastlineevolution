This is the final project for Earth System Modeling by Marcus Kurth and Angela Jackson.
Important Note: GitHub does not allow files larger than 25 MB to be uploaded to the repository so we had to compress our walkthrough video which diminished the quality.
If you would like us to send you the higher quality video through Google Drive or other means please let one of us know.
Thank you for a great semester.
